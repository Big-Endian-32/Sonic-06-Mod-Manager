        Language Resources
    
        To add a language, add a new entry to the 'local:Languages' section using the following template;
        
        <local:Language FileName="en-GB" Name="English (United Kingdom)"/>
    
        Ensure that your language's XAML resource is named after the culture code for your region
        and correctly describes the localisation you have provided. For a list of officially supported
        culture codes, visit the following link;
    
        https://azuliadesigns.com/c-sharp-tutorials/list-net-culture-country-codes
    
        Set the FileName key to the name of the XAML file you created containing your language's text.
    
        Set the Name key to the localised name of your language and describe either the region or the
        English version of the language next to it in brackets.
    
        For example, a Russian localisation would look like the following;
    
        <local:Language FileName="ru-RU" Name="Русский (Russia)"/>
    -->
    
    <local:Languages x:Key="Languages">
        <local:Language FileName="en-GB" Name="English (United Kingdom)"/>
    </local:Languages>
