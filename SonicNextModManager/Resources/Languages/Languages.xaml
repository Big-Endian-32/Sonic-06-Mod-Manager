        Language Resources
    
        To add a language, simply add a new entry to the 'local:Languages' section using the
        template below;
        
        <local:Language FileName="en-GB" Name="English (United Kingdom)"/>
    
        Ensure that your language's XAML resource is named after the culture code for your region
        and correctly describes the translation you have provided for your region. For a list of
        officially supported culture codes, please visit the link below;
    
        https://lonewolfonline.net/list-net-culture-country-codes
    
        Set the file name to the name of the XAML you created containing your language's text.
        As for the name, set it to the name of your language in your actual culture and describe
        either the region or the English version of the language next to it in brackets.
    
        For example, a Russian translation would use the 'ru-RU' culture code and the name would
        appear in the languages list as 'Русский (Russia)'.
