#Sonic '06 Mod Manager
A tool designed to make it easier to use and manage mods for SONIC THE HEDGEHOG (2006) on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

#Building
To manually build the Mod Manager, simply clone this repository to a location on your computer and open the Sonic '06 Mod Manager.sln file in Visual Studio (only VS2019 has being tested for this, but any recent version should be able to compile). Right click on the project in the Solution Explorer and choose Rebuild Solution to build an executable in `..\Sonic '06 Mod Manager\bin\Debug`.
If you just wish to use the Manager without touching the code, simply grab the most recent stable release from https://github.com/Knuxfan24/Sonic-06-Mod-Manager/releases
